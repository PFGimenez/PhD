  "body": "# PhD on preferences learning and recommendation under constraints\r\n\r\n_My work is based on the SLDD compilator [SALADD](https://github.com/SchmidtNicolas/SALADD) by Nicolas Schmidt._\r\n\r\n## Interactive recommender demonstrator\r\n\r\nA [Dockerfile](https://github.com/PFgimenez/thesis/blob/recoDemoServer/demonstrateur/Dockerfile) is available to build the interactive recommender demonstrator.\r\n\r\nTo build the image : (this may take a few minutes)\r\n\r\n    sudo docker build --no-cache=true -t recodemoserver https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PFgimenez/thesis/recoDemoServer/demonstrateur/Dockerfile\r\n\r\nOnce the image is built, you can start the server :\r\n\r\n    sudo docker run -d --name instancereco -p 80:80 recodemoserver\r\n\r\nTo stop the server :\r\n\r\n    sudo docker stop instancereco && sudo docker rm instancereco\r\n\r\nSome remarks :\r\n\r\n- When the server is started, you can access it with a browser at the adress http://127.0.0.1\r\n- Internet access is needed to build the image, but not to run it.\r\n- Only one instance of the server can run at the same time.\r\n- If you want to upgrade the server, you need to build it again (with the same line as above).\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n#### 32 bits system\r\n\r\nUse this link to build the image :\r\n\r\n    sudo docker build --no-cache=true -t recodemoserver https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PFgimenez/thesis/recoDemoServer/demonstrateur/Dockerfile-32bits\r\n    \r\nThe other steps aren't changed.\r\n\r\n#### DNS problem\r\n\r\nDocker build can fail if you are behind intranet. The error will look like :\r\n\r\n    Could not resolve 'security.debian.org'\r\n\r\nThis is a DNS error. First, find the DNS server addressÂ you use :\r\n\r\n    nm-tool | grep DNS\r\n    \r\nAt the end of the file /etc/default/docker, add the line (replace with your actual DNS address) :\r\n\r\n    DOCKER_OPTS=\"--dns 1.2.3.4\"\r\n    \r\nRestart the docker deamon :\r\n\r\n    sudo service docker restart\r\n    \r\nYou can build the image.\r\n",
